# CyberTracker

CyberTracker is a flexible platform for creating data capture apps.

Data capture applications are a specialized class of apps that allow a user to enter data and then upload it to a backend service.

CyberTracker is built on the Qt Framework and runs on Windows, MacOS, iOS and Android.

## Building CyberTracker

**Note** It is not required to build CyberTracker in order to use it. Once you have the mobile app on your phone, you will be able to develop apps. However, in order to debug your application, you'll need to build the full application.

### Dependencies

All dependencies are build time dependencies in the form of git submodules.
* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) provides the application framework.
* [ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt](https://developers.arcgis.com/qt/) provides an advanced GIS layer.
